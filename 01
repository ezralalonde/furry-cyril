1-1. Comment one the choice of names and values
in the following code:

    >#define TRUE 0
    >#define FALSE 1
    >
    >if ((ch = getchar()) == EOF)
    >    not_eof = FALSE;

    The values of "TRUE" and "FALSE" are the
    "inverse" of their usual values, so that
    they will confuse.

    For example, the code:

        printf("1 == 1 is '%d'\n", 1 == 1);

    prints:

        1 == 1 is '1'

    Since 1 == 1 is "true", and "1", defining
    TRUE to be zero "0" leads to confusion.

    Consider:

        if (TRUE) {
            printf("Hello, world!\n");
        }

    and:

        if (FALSE) {
            printf("Goodbye, cruel world!\n");
        }

    By inspecting the code, you would expect
    that "Hello World!" would always appear
    when run, and that "Goodbye, cruel world!"
    never would. This code defies that
    expectation, and is therefore bad.

    The name "not_eof" carries on this kind of
    confusion, since it is assigned "FALSE" in
    the fragment, making this a double-negation
    of a weird and wrongly-defined value.

1-2. Improve this function:

    >int smaller(char *s, char *t) {
    >   if (strcmp(s, t) < 1)
    >       return 1;
    >   else
    >       return 0;
    >}

    The value "1" in the comparison is incorrect.
    It should read "0", since my version of
    strcmp "returns an integer less than 0".
    Using a value of 1 would allow for strings
    that are equal to be returned as "smaller".

    I would define the function as:

        int smaller(char *s, char*) {
            return (strcmp(s, t) < 0)
        }

    since the values returned are equal to the
    value returned by the expression, and there
    is therefore no need for the if-statement.

1-3. Read this code aloud:

    if ((falloc(SMRHSHSCRTCH, S_IFEXT|0644,
        MAXRODDHSH) < 0)

    This code has names that are impossible to
    pronounce, and difficult to spell and
    remember.

1-4. Improve each of these fragments:

    >if ( !(c == 'y' || c == 'Y') )
    >   return;

    >length = (length < BUFSIZE) ? length : BUFSIZE;

    >flag = flag ? 0 : 1;

    >quote = (*line == '"') ? 1 : 0;

    >if (val & 1)
    >   bit = 1;
    >else
    >   bit = 0;

    I would write the first as:

        if (c != 'Y' && c != 'y') {
            return;
        }

    I would write the second as:

    if (length > BUFSIZE) {
        length = BUFSIZE;
    }

    I have seen the third one in production
    code, so I know what it does. I prefer
    the construction:

        flag = !flag;

    as I think this makes it more clear that
    you are "switching" a flag.

    I would write the fourth as:

        quote = (*line == '"');

    Finally, I would write the fifth to be:

        bit = (val & 1);

    In my last two constructions I have parens
    that are superfluous, but I think they're
    okay because I hate thinking about operator
    precedence and I'm never confident of the
    precedence of pointer and bitwise.

1-5. What is wrong with this excerpt?

    >int read(int *ip) {
    >   scan("%d", ip);
    >   return *ip;
    >}
    >   ...
    >insert(&graph[vert], read(&val), read(&ch));

    The order of operations of evaluating the
    operations is important here, but evaluation
    of arguments to a function happen in
    undefined order. So, confusion could be
    caused if they don't evaluate in the
    "expected" order.

    Also, I would rather return the result of
    scan, rather than the value read. This is
    because it is then possible to check for
    an error, and the value is still available.

    My rewrite would be as follows:

        int read(int *ip) {
            return scan("%d", ip);
        }
            ...
        check(read(&val));
        check(read(&ch));
        insert(&graph[vert], val, ch);

    where "check" is a function that makes sure
    that the return value of the function is
    okay.

1-6. List all the different outputs this could
produce with various orders of evaluation:

    >n = 1;
    >printf("%d %d\n", n++, n++);

    Try it on as many compilers as you can, to
    see what happens in practice.

    I could see the following outputs being
    possibilities, since execution of "++", and
    arguments are both in undefined order:

        1 1
        1 2
        1 3
        2 1
        2 2
        2 3
        3 1
        3 2
        3 3

    The "extremes" would be evaluated as:

        printf("%d %d\n", n + 2, n + 2);

    and:

        printf("%d %d\n", n, n);

    and the other values are possible using the
    same idea, varying the parameters from the
    initial value "n", "n + 1", and the
    final value "n + 2".

        printf("%d %d\n", n + 1, n);

    Using my compiler[1], I get:

        2 1

1-7. Rewrite these C/C++ excerpts more clearly:

    >if (istty(stdin)) ;
    >else if (istty(stdout)) ;
    >   else if (istty(stderr)) ;
    >       else return(0);

    >if (retval != SUCCESS)
    >   return (retval);
    >}
    >/* All went well! */
    >return SUCCESS;

    >for (k = 0; k== < 5; x += dx)
    >   scanf("%lf", %dx);

    For the first, I would rewrite:

        if !(istty(stdin) || istty(stoud) ||
                             istty(stderr)) {
            return 0;
        }

    For the second:

        return retval;

    For the third:

        for (kk = 0; kk < 5; kk++) {
            x += dx;
            scanf(%lf", &dx);
        }

        My formulation of this seems odd to me,
        since the last value of "dx" is never
        used. I would prefer to rewrite so that
        the "accumulation" of x comes *after*
        the scan.

1-8. Idenfity the errors in this Java fragment
    and repair it by rewriting with an idiomatic
    loop:

    >int count = 0;
    >while (count < total) {
    >   count++;
    >   if (this.getName(count) == nametable.userName()) {
    >       return (true);
    >   }
    >}

    I would rewrite this:

        for (int ii = 0; ii < total; ii++) {
            if (this.getName(count) == nametable.userName()) {
                return true;
            }
        }
